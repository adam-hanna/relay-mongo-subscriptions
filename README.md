# Relay Mongo Subscriptions

This library can be used to implement relay subscriptions with MongoDB.

## Installation

This library is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/relay-mongo-subscriptions) and is as easy to install as:

```bash
$ npm i --save relay-mongo-subscriptions
```

## Demo

A simple TODO demo can be found, [here](https://github.com/adam-hanna/relay-mongo-subscriptions-example).

## Quickstart

```bash
$ npm i --save relay-mongo-subscriptions
```

**schema.graphql**

```graphql
scalar Object

type TodoForSubscription {
  _id: ID!
  description: String!
  completed: Boolean!
}

type TruncatedArrays {
  field: String!
  newSize: Int!
}

type UpdateDescription {
  updatedFields: Object!
  removedFields: [String!]!
  truncatedArrays: [TruncatedArrays!]!
}

type TodoSubscription {
  doc: TodoForSubscription!
  operationType: String!
  updateDescription: UpdateDescription
}

type Subscription {
  todosChanged: [TodoSubscription!]!
}
```

**server.ts**

```typescript
import {
  Collection,
  Db,
  MongoClient,
} from 'mongodb'
import Watcher from 'relay-mongo-subscriptions/lib/watcher'

const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017', {})
await client.connect()

const db = client.db('todos');
const todosCollection = db.collection('todos')

const watcher = Watcher.getInstance()
watcher.setCollections({
  collections: [todosCollection]
})
await watcher.openChangeStreams()
```

**subscriptions.ts**

```typescript
import PubSub from 'relay-mongo-subscriptions/lib/pubsub'

export const subscriptions = {
    todosChanged: {
        subscribe: (parent, args, context, info): AsyncIterator<any> => {
            return PubSub({
              collectionName: 'todos',
              query: {}, // note: if you wanted to query the todo's, you could pick it up from args.query, etc
              delay: 500,
              leading: false,
              trailing: true,
            })
        },
        // @ts-ignore
        resolve: payload => {
            return payload
        }
    }
}
```

## Methodology

This library opens a [change stream](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/) on the passed collections. As documents come in through the stream, they are checked against the queries given in the `PubSub`. The matching algorithm used is the one from [Meteor.js minimongo](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/minimongo/matcher.js). Documents that match are pushed into a buffer and, via a throttle, pushed in an array down the wire to the client.

## Notes

### Delete

The biggest caveat is that you cannot delete documents from the collection. When a document is deleted, it is not included in the change stream and therefore cannot be matched against a query.

Rather, I suggest using some sort of boolean to flip between active/disabled.

### Enabling Change Streams

Change streams are only available for [replica sets or sharded clusters](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/#availability). To convert a standalone instance to a replica set, follow [this guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/convert-standalone-to-replica-set/).

If you are using AWS DocumentDB, you will need to first [enable change streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/change_streams.html), and secondly, when creating the collections, you will need to set the read preference to primary. e.g.

```typescript
import { 
    ...,
    ReadPreference,
} from 'mongodb'

const todosCollection = db.collection('todos', { readPreference: ReadPreference.PRIMARY })
```
